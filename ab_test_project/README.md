# Project - Evaluation of the A/B test and results

## Business areas

E-commerce, StartUp

## Task

To evaluate the results of an A/B test, based on a dataset with user actions, TOR and several additional datasets

## Libraries and Skills
*python, pandas, matplotlib, plotly.express, plotly.graph_objects, scipy, numpy, statsmodels, multitest, proportions_ztest, data preprocessing, A/B-test validity assessment, exploratory data analysis, A/B test results evaluation, create of events funnel, check the conversion*

## Conclusion

Based on the results of the analysis, I can conclude that it is not recommended to trust the results of the test, since a fairly large number of violations were identified that could negatively affect the test results, including the failure to obtain adequate conversion rates.
It is recommended to conduct the test again, taking into account and minimizing the possible negative factors that were mentioned.

## Project status
Completed.
